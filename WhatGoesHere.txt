=============================================================================
At this level of the repository filesystem, the contents are categorized by
how Subversion interacts with the repository:

usr : my small, rapid development.  intended to be painless to update from repo.
big : my big, perhaps slower development.  might be quite expensive to update.
svn_externals : strictly refers to external repos, no local development.
